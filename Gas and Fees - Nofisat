## WHAT IS GAS?

Gas is like airtime or fuel. it’s what powers things on the Ethereum network.  
Every time someone sends money, swaps tokens, or uses a smart contract, it takes energy.  
That energy is called gas, and it’s paid in a small amount of ETH.

Without gas, people could overload the system for free. So gas makes sure the network stays fast, fair, and free from spam.

Example
Sending ETH to a friend = costs a little gas
Interacting with a smart contract = costs more gas

## EIP-1559 CHANGES

Before, users had to guess the right fee to get their transaction through and that caused a lot of stress and delays.
EIP-1559 fixed that by creating a clearer and better system:

- Base Fee: This is the standard price everyone pays. It goes up or down based on how busy the network is.  
- Priority Fee (Tip): You can add a little extra i.e  a tip to get your transaction picked faster by validators.  
- Burning ETH: The base fee isn’t kept it’s burned, meaning it's destroyed forever. This helps reduce ETH supply.

So now, gas fees are clearer, more stable, and less frustrating.

Formula:
Total Fee = Gas Limit x (Base Fee + Priority Fee)

Example:
If Gas Limit = 21,000
Base Fee = 20 gwei
Priority Fee = 2 gwei

Then: Total Fee =21,000 x (20+2) =426,000 gwei = 0.000462 ETH


## SLIPPAGE

Slippage happens when you think a transaction will cost one amount, but it ends up costing more or less by the time it goes through.

This usually happens when:
- The network is very busy
- Lots of people are trying to swap tokens at once

If you set your gas fee too low, your transaction might be delayed or fail.  
That small change or gap in what you expected to pay versus what actually happened is called slippage.

Example:
If you set gas the gas fee at 30 gwei, but by the time the transaction get picked, the network now requires 40 gwei.
The transaction will fail unless the gass fee is adjusted to the required amount. That difference between 30 gwei and 40 gwei, which is 10 gwei, is the slippage.
