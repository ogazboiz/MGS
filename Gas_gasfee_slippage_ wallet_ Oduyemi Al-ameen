Ether (ETH) is Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, acting as the fundamental asset for transactions and operations on the Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum Gas and Fees:
 * Gas: A unit measuring the computational effort for an operation on Ethereum. More complex operations consume more gas.
 * Fee: The cost of a transaction, calculated as Gas Units Consumed Ã— Gas Price. Paid in ETH.
EIP-1559 Fee Structure:
 * Base Fee: A dynamic, protocol-set fee that is burned (removed from circulation), adjusted based on network congestion.
 * Priority Fee (Tip): An optional payment to validators for faster transaction inclusion.
 * Users specify a maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas. The protocol charges the sum of the actual base fee and priority fee, refunding any excess from maxFeePerGas. This system improves fee predictability.
Slippage:
 * The difference between an expected transaction outcome (e.g., price, gas cost) and its actual outcome upon execute  Users set "slippage tolerance" to manage this risk, preventing transactions if costs exceed a set threshold.
