## Ethereum Gas, EIP-1559, and Slippage – Explained

1. What is Gas?
Gas is the unit that measures the computational effort required to perform operations on the Ethereum blockchain. Every transaction (e.g., sending ETH, swapping tokens, minting NFTs, executing a smart contract) consumes gas.

Purpose of Gas:
Regulates computational cost: More complex transactions cost more gas.

Prevents spam: Users pay for computation, which deters malicious activity.

Incentivizes validators: Validators (or block proposers) earn gas fees as a reward.

Example Gas Cost:
// A simple ETH transfer might cost around 21,000 gas
Gas Used × Gas Price = Total Fee
21,000 × 30 gwei = 630,000 gwei = 0.00063 ETH


2. EIP-1559: A Gas Fee Revolution
EIP-1559 introduced a dual-fee model in Ethereum’s London upgrade (2021), improving fee predictability and user experience.

Components:
Base Fee: Automatically set by the network and adjusted per block based on demand. This part is burned (destroyed), reducing ETH supply.

Priority Fee (Tip): Optional extra fee users pay to incentivize validators to prioritize their transactions.

Max Fee: The highest total fee a user is willing to pay (includes base + priority).

Fee Structure Diagram:
Total Fee Paid = Base Fee (burned) + Priority Fee (goes to validator)

Burn Mechanism:
EIP-1559 burns the base fee, introducing a deflationary pressure on ETH supply.

User pays: 30 gwei base + 2 gwei tip
- 30 gwei gets burned
- 2 gwei goes to validator


3. Slippage and Gas Prices
Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it’s actually executed.

How It Happens:
In high-demand blocks, network congestion increases.

If your transaction is delayed due to low gas, the price of tokens may shift before execution.

In DEX swaps, this can lead to users receiving fewer tokens than expected.

Example Scenario:
You're swapping 1 ETH for DAI at an expected rate of 1 ETH = 2,000 DAI.
Due to low gas price or sudden demand, your transaction is mined later, and the price changes to 1 ETH = 1,950 DAI — causing slippage.
