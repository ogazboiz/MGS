# What the Hell is Gas Fee and Why Should I Care?

Think of **gas fee** as a **transaction fee** on the blockchain. It's paid in every transaction you make and goes to **validators** or **miners** to keep the blockchain **secure** and **decentralized**.

## Who are Validators / Miners?

**Validators** or **miners** are people who **validate every transaction** on the blockchain. They ensure that the chain remains **secure** and **decentralized**.

## Why Should I Pay Them My Money?

There are two major types of consensus mechanisms:

1. **Proof of Work (PoW):**
   - Validators (miners) use **computational power/energy** to solve complex mathematical problems (cryptography).
   - This process validates transactions and includes them in blocks.

2. **Proof of Stake (PoS):**
   - Validators **stake their tokens** in the blockchain.
   - They use computational resources to validate transactions.

In both systems, **validating transactions is resource-intensive**. The **gas fee** is your way of **thanking them** and **paying for the infrastructure** that keeps the blockchain running. 

In some blockchains, gas fees are not just for validator rewardsâ€”they're also used to **maintain the security and operations** of the network.

## What is EIP-1559 and Why Should I Care?

Once upon a time, the Ethereum chain became **congested**â€”too many people making transactions at the same time, like a **traffic jam**.

During this period, validators prioritized transactions based on how **high** the gas fee was. Some users ended up paying **2â€“3x** their transaction value just to get included.

To solve this, Ethereum introduced **EIP-1559**, which added two key concepts:

### ðŸ”¹ Base Fee
- This is the **minimum fee** for a transaction.
- It's **adjusted based on network congestion**.
- Over time, base fees are **burned**, reducing ETH supply.

### ðŸ”¹ Priority Fee (Tip)
- A small **tip to validators**.
- Think of it as a **thank you message sent in advance** to prioritize your transaction.

## What is Slippage and Why Should I Care?

**Slippage** is your **risk tolerance** for **price changes** during a volatile market.

Example:
- You're buying a token at **$1 each** and want to spend **$100**.
- But the token price is **volatile**.
- You set your **slippage to 2%**, meaning you're okay with the price going slightly down or up.
- If the price rises, you may end up with **98 tokens** instead of 100.

Setting slippage protects you from **failed transactions** but also determines **how much price movement you're willing to accept**.
