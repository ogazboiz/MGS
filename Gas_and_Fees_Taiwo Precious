Explain your understanding of Gas and Fees in Ethereum, including how ElP-1559 changed the fee structure.
Gas in Ethereum is basically the fuel that powers transactions and operations on the network. Every action, whether it's sending ETH or interacting with a smart contract, requires a certain amount of gas to be executed. The more complex the action, the more gas it needs. It's like paying for how much computing power your transaction takes up.   Before EIP-1559, the way fees worked was more of a guessing game. Users had to set their own gas prices, and miners would naturally prioritize transactions with higher fees. This led to congestion and unpredictable fees during busy periods because everyone was trying to outbid each other to get their transactions confirmed faster.    EIP-1559 came in to make things smoother and more predictable. It introduced a base fee that automatically adjusts depending on network demand, and that base fee gets burnedâ€”meaning it's completely removed from circulation. Users can still add a little tip (called a priority fee) to speed things up, but overall the system is fairer and more efficient. Plus, the burning of fees adds a deflationary effect to ETH, which could help increase its value over time.
Define slippage in the context of gas calculations.
Slippage in the context of gas calculations refers to the difference between the expected gas cost and the actual gas cost when a transaction is confirmed. It usually happens when the network gets busier between the time you submit your transaction and when it's actually processed. So even if you set a gas fee you're comfortable with, the final amount you pay might be higher or lower depending on network activity at that moment.
