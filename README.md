#### **Tasks:**  

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Fork [ogazboiz/MGS](https://github.com/ogazboiz/MGS) to your GitHub account.  

2. **Create Your File**  
   - In your forked repo, create a file named:  
     ```  
     Gas_and_Fees_YourName.adoc  
     ```  
     (Replace `YourName` with your actual name, e.g., `Gas_and_Fees_Alex.adoc`.)  

3. **Write Your Explanation**  
   - In the file, answer:  
     - **What is Gas?** Describe its purpose in Ethereum transactions.  
     - **EIP-1559:** Explain how it reformed gas fees (base fee, priority fee, burning mechanism).  
     - **Slippage:** Define it and how it relates to gas prices (e.g., in swaps or high-demand blocks).  

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Push your file to your forked repo.  
   - Open a PR to the original `ogazboiz/MGS` repo with the title:

Gas is the unit measuring computational work on Ethereum. It prevents spam by requiring fees for transactions...  

## EIP-1559 Changes  
- Introduced a **base fee** (burned) and **priority fee** (tip to validators).  
- Dynamic pricing adjusts fees based on block congestion...  

## Slippage  
Slippage occurs when the gas price changes before a transaction is mined, causing higher costs...  
```
